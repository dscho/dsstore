Mac::Finder::DSStore provides routines for reading and writing the
.DS_Store files generated by the Macintosh Finder. Files can be
read, created from scratch, or some simple manipulations are possible.

For more information on the format of the files, see the notes
in the accompanying POD file, installed as Mac::Finder::DSStore::Format.

The interfaces provided by this module right now are not very convenient
and require some knowledge of the file format to use. I expect to add
some more high-level / convenient functions in the future.

INSTALLATION

This uses the standard(?) Build.PL method:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

You'll need Module::Build installed. Alternately, just copy the .pm files
into the appropriate places in your include path.
