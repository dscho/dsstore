Mac::Finder::DSStore provides routines for reading and writing the
.DS_Store files generated by the Macintosh Finder. Files can be
read, created from scratch, or some simple manipulations are possible.

For more information on the format of the files, see the notes
in the accompanying POD file, installed as Mac::Finder::DSStore::Format.

There are some examples in the examples/ directory:

   examples/dumprecs.pl
     A minimal example of reading the DSDB records and printing them to stdout.

   examples/circle.pl
     Demonstrates creating a DS_Store file from scratch.

   examples/dsstore_dump.pl
     Attempts to dump a store file's records in a more human-readable format
     (specifically, as a perl script which will recreate the store file).

INSTALLATION

This uses the standard(?) Build.PL method:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

You'll need Module::Build installed. Alternately, just copy the .pm files
into the appropriate places in your include path. The DSStore module itself
is pure Perl and should run on any system, but several of the demos require
the Mac::Files and Mac::Memory modules for access to Macintosh system library
calls to manipulate alias records.

HACKING

There is a Mercurial repository for this module at
