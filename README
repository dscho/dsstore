Mac::Finder::DSStore provides routines for reading and writing the
.DS_Store files generated by the Macintosh Finder. Files can be
read, created from scratch, or some simple manipulations are possible.

For more information on the format of the files, see the notes
in the accompanying POD file, installed as Mac::Finder::DSStore::Format.

There are some examples in the examples/ directory:

   examples/dumprecs.pl
     A minimal example of reading the DSDB records and printing them to stdout.

   examples/circle.pl
     Demonstrates creating a DS_Store file from scratch.

   examples/dsstore_dump.pl
     Attempts to dump a store file's records in a more human-readable format
     (specifically, as a perl script which will recreate the store file).

INSTALLATION

This uses the standard(?) Build.PL method:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build install

You'll need Module::Build installed. Alternately, just copy the .pm files
into the appropriate places in your include path.

HACKING

There is a Mercurial repository for this module at
    http://www.hhhh.org/src/hg/dsstore/

There is an older repository at FreeHg:
    http://freehg.org/u/wiml/dsstore/
but FreeHg has been down a lot, so its copy is probably out of date.
